Title: An example of a header comment.

Headers should contain a title, description, author and date. They allow a user
to quickly understand the purpose of the code without having to read every
line. Including the author serves slightly as some form of copyright, but also
indicates who should be contacted if there is a query. The date lets you know
if there have been any updates since it was written (either in the software or
the project [e.g. new data released]).
