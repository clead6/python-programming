PHYS20161 - Assignment 3 - Nuclear Decay 
-------------------------------------
This python script reads in data from .csv files. It then
validates the imported data by:

1) checking for first condition
2) checking for second condition
3) checking for third condition

If an element is found that breaks one of these rules
then something is done.
The script then performs a variety of things to understand beta decay.
